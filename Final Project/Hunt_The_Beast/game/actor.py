class Actor:
# Description:
#   A visible, moveable thing that participates in the game it keeps track of all the attributes
#
# OOP Principles Used:
#   Encapsulation, Polymorphism
#
# Reasoning:
#   This class uses encapsulation becuase there is functions to set and get attributes of actors but no way 
#   manually change the data inside 
#
#   It also uses polymorphism because it difines attributes that most actors have but different data can be put
#   in depending on the actor
